The Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland (LLR) Care Record is part of the national Shared Care Record (ShCR) programme.  This will give health and care professionals directly involved in an individualâ€™s care a more complete view of the care and treatment that they have received across all services.

 The LLR Care Record is being progressed by the three local clinical commissioning groups (CCGs); University Hospitals of Leicester (UHL); Leicestershire Partnership Trust (LPT); the three upper tier local authorities and other local partners including East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS), DHU111, care homes and pharmacies.

The LLR Care Record implements technology components from the [Interweave product set](https://www.interweavedigital.com/).  This is a set of technical capabilities originally developed for the Yorkshire and Humber Care Record but since rolled out more widely across other regions.
